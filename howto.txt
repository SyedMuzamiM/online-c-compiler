How to Use the Compiler :
---------------------------
1. Type in your code in the given textarea OR Upload a saved code using the Upload option.
2. Click on "Save To Server" to save the file.
3. Once Saved, the code appears in the saved codes division at the right.
4. To Delete a code click on the (x) appearing on the file (Be Careful There).
5. If You wish to give inputs. Save all your inputs in a text file (.txt extension).
	The inputs are to be given as space seperated values in order such that the input to be read first is the leftmost input.
6. Click on "Compile and Execute" to compile and run your code (in case inputs are given, they are considered during execution)

-----
NOTE:
-----
1. Do Save your code before executing it.
2. The Uploaded input file is cleared after the code execution.
3. Hence, the input file needs to be uploaded for every execution(in case it is needed).
4. Directly clicking on compile and execute will not consider the recent changes made after the last save action.
